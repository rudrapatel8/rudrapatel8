Hey there! I’m Rudra Patel, a Computer Science and Data Science student at Rutgers University, passionate about building intelligent systems and exploring the intersection of software engineering, data, and AI.

I enjoy working on projects that combine data-driven insights with scalable engineering, whether it’s through designing clean front-end experiences or developing models that uncover meaningful trends from complex datasets.

🔍 Current Focus
- Exploring LLM fine-tuning, RAG pipelines, and multimodal AI applications.

- Gaining hands-on experience with data science workflows – from data wrangling and visualization to predictive modeling using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch).

- Deepening my understanding of web technologies like React, Node.js, and Next.js to create dynamic, responsive interfaces.

- Experimenting with cloud tooling for deploying and scaling ML-backed web applications.

⚡ Projects & Interests
- Some things I love building:

- Data dashboards that transform raw numbers into clear stories.

- AI-driven features for web apps using APIs like OpenAI and Hugging Face.

- Chrome extensions or tools that improve productivity or learning.

🏀 Outside of Tech
When I’m not writing code, you’ll probably find me:

-Watching or playing NBA, basketball, or volleyball

-Catching up on anime (especially Demon Slayer, One Piece, and Black Clover)

-Reading books that blend science, psychology, and creativity

-Tracking the latest in AI advancements, from state-of-the-art transformer architectures to emerging trends in agentic systems and AI alignment research
